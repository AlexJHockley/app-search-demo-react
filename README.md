# App Search React Demo

This is the completed React tutorial. It provides a solution to the challenge at the end of the tutorial, which is to add the ability to handle asynchronous requests. The `master` branch has a full, robust solution that you can work from -- it even has a nice design.

Thanks for trying out the tutorial. :)
